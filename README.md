### What is this?
This is the **organizational page** for the **Sector student project**. It is a cooperation of the universities of **Clausthal**, **Göttingen** and **Rostock**. We join forces for a distributed student project activity and aim at a prototype for blockchain based publishing. 

### Why should I participate?
This is a **real-life project**. Similarly as with earlier activities now known as [Tweedback](https://twbk.io), [Vestifi](https://vestifi.de) or [Koopango](https://koopango.com), we have a use case in which we place our trust. It is based on published,  peer-reviewed research work and we have (several) proof of concept implementations. Now we want to make that brain child fly - and we have no idea, where this will end up. Once again you have the chance of participating in a real-world project and move on from there. _If this is to your liking: Your should participate._

Of course, this whould be mapped somehow on **academic course scenarios**. For Rostock based students, this currently is a **KSWS and a Bachelor project in winter term 20-21**. We are in the process of turnign this into a sponsored research project, as well.

### What is the use case?
We want to **ensure publication quality on the blockchain** - which is why one of our first prototypes is called "_publishing on the blogchain [sic]_". 

Imagine a scientist publishes his or her thoughts **on a blog** and gets good reviews on this. From a _research point of view_, this sounds great! From an _academic perspective_, traditional journal and conference-type of publications are expected, as only they are considered reliable, peer-reviewed proofs of academic achievements. The owner of a science blog could easily fake positive reviews and manipulate the texts in many ways.

**This is what we want to change.** We want to _disrupt the academic publishing business_ by offering everybody the chance of writing papers, publishing them freely, collecting authentic reviews from their peers and using this as basis for their academic achievement record. We shall use _blockchain technology_ to ensure the authenticity of reviews and feedback. 

**Sounds similar as AirBnB or Uber?** Yes! _You've got the point._ (Disclaimer: Participation here is not aimed at becoming the next Mark Z*****berg but at working together on a fun project in whose concepts we believe).

### Where can I read more about this?

* **Our core paper** [Cap, Leiding: Blogchain - Disruptives Publizieren auf der Blockchain ](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1365/s40702-018-00470-w) has been published in 2018 at HMD Wirtschaftsinformatik. It is open access and can be read under the link above. You can find open versions with a Google query as well. 
* We have an **extended version of this paper** as a chapter in the book [Fill, Meier: Blockchain: Grundlagen, Anwendungsszenarien aund Nutzungspotentiale](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-658-28006-2). We can share this only on a private basis due to copyright restrictions by the publisher. Your university library might have a Springer Link subscription.
* Finally, one of us gave a **keynote speech on this at the 2019 meeting of the German computer society** GI and the slides of this talk are available [here](https://github.com/clecap/blockchain-masterclass/blob/master/vortrag-v03.pdf). This talk also provides links to four proof of concept projects we have completed and to three student Theses, which had this concept at their core.

### How can I participate?
**If you are from Rostock**, register yourself at the corresponding _KSWS or project course in StudIP_ and/or write _a mail to clemens.cap AT uni-rostock.de_

### How will this continue?

1. There is a **kick-off event on Zoom** on **November 5 at 12:00**. Registered parties will receive an email with the Zoom link. So please make sure you register at StudIP or by sending an meail to clemens.cap AT uni-rostock.de.
1. From then on, we shall have **regular weekly meetings** on Zoom. In between we shall be working on specification and programming tasks. 
1. There will be **occasional lectures and tutorials** on blockchain technology and other aspects we shall need. There is plenty of material online for that, including a blockchain course from Göttingen and a blockchain summerschool Rostock had organized in Tallinn some time ago. 


### What am I expected to do?

As usual in a KSWS and project type of lecture, you are expected to

1. Follow the lectures and tutorials provided (online or offline mode).
1. Contribute with specifying, programming and testing (you will do so on Github, so it is pretty easy to trace your contribution).
1. Have fun in what we expect to be an interesting and daring project.


### What is the language of this course?
In this course we shall be using English as medium of communication. 95% of the relevant literature is in English.


### Tools 

In this course we are **not** using StudIP (except for initial registration). _First_, we have no common user base or single sign on for students in Rostock and Göttingen. _Second_, we want to use and practice the use of tools which are used by practitioners in the field.

In this course we shall be **using the following tools**.

* **Github** for achieved **results**, such as documentation (preferably in markdown as this can be edited directly) and code. Our repository is https://github.com/clecap/sector-coop. To get access to this private repository, get a github account and send a mail with your account id to clemens.cap AT uni-rostock.de
* **Cryptpad** for shared **real-time edit** such as discussions, brainstorming and organizational work, where multiple persons need edit rights. In particular it supports shared Kanban, shared markdown and shared drive, just as Google Docs does but without their privacy problems. 
* **Youtube** for some instructional videos. (TODO: GOE)
* **Mailing list** for notifications and actively pushed information. (TODO: HRO)

### Technologies

Presumably we shall be using **Javascript** as the main interconnecting language of our system. Knowledge and/or interest in Javascript and node.js is definitely and advantage. we will also apply **blockchain techniques** in our work.

You might be interested in getting a jump-start in Blockchain technology. For this, we already have prepared some lecture material and will put this online soon. Also, we will be talking on this on our first meeting on November 5, 12:00, as outlined above.


### Note
A final remark on this page: We are going to use Github for results only - and this page ist just trying to get you on board.

You will find a live version of this document at https://cryptpad.fr/code/#/2/code/view/eDHWRRRvBDlpg0pX6BSnak3bkIXWTtAlK5ChqxRhsv0/

This is a dynamic web page with shared editing for the use of the organizers of this course: Arne Bochem, Clemens Cap and Benjamin Leiding. The contents may and will change. It also has a history feature. It allows many more features than Etherpad and strives to become a privacy-conscious alternative for Google Docs. I (Clemens Cap) found this a few weeks ago and I am fascinated by the concept. I hope ;-) it is ready for prime time project use.
