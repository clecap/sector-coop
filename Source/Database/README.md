You'll find four SQL files here. These contain the same statements as mentioned in the [server setup guide](../User-Client/Documentation/Installation.md) but compiled as SQL files for getting started easier. If the databases were set up using the guide only, these can be ignored as they will do the same things.
Otherwise, use `documentDatabase.sql` first, then connect to the database and then run the query `documentSchema.sql`. Perform analogous steps for the identity database.
