To become a patron the signature needs to be signed by a super identity which can either be one central super identity or part of a key hierarchy (similar to SSL certificate hierarchy). For example a university could be such a patron, handing out tokens to its researchers.</td>

            <td>Pseudonym/Identity</td>

                A useraccount on our Identity Storage system. The Identity storage sees a username and linked to it a datablob. Given the correct password, the identity storage will allow reads, updates and delete to the user account and datablob. One SecTor Acc may have any number of identities.

        <tr>
            <td>Token</td>
            <td>A sort of currency that is bound to an identity and cannot be traded with other identities. By registering an identity with a patron, one is granted tokens. To submit documents one needs to make an transaction which costs a certain amount of tokens.</td>

            <td>UserClient</td>
            <td>JS Userinterface, which handles most of the logic. Allows login to the identity storage to downloaded ones own user data and display it. One can handle its identities here, create new identities, apply to a patron for tokens, use tokens to upload a new document and search for documents. Should also support exporting and importing data blobs, such that users don't have to use the Identity Storage or can make backups for themselves.</td>
